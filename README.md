Mini tools I built to make my time working on the Intelligent Inbox product smooth and efficient.

## Tools in this repo

### SOID Capture Tool (Tampermonkey Script)
- **File:** `SOIDcapturetool.user.js`
- **Purpose:** Quickly capture and copy SOIDs (Smart Order IDs) from various Pepr app environments. Provides a draggable popup, keyboard shortcuts for copying, and fields for annotating inbounds.
- **How to use:** Install as a Tampermonkey userscript in your browser. Works on Troia, Majestic, GoFresh, Kohl, and Ace Endico Pepr apps.

More tools may be added as needed to support workflow automation and QA for the Intelligent Inbox product.
